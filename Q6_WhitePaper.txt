Q6 White Paper

So the job that we were tasked with this time was reversing an string from an inputfile for example
yes should be sey or death is htaed. So for this we were told to use an array-based stack, so I 
created a class called Stack to hold the variables needed including the top the limit of the array 
and the char* array. From there, two important functions are checking whether the array is full or 
whether the array is empty so we made an IsFull and an IsEmpty functions who both take a (Stack* stack) 
argument. Next we start the stack with the StartStack function to create the stack and allocating the 
memory needed by multiplying both the stack's limit and the sizeofchars. There is also the required 
push on the stack and pop off the stack. Lastly the most important function the strswitch is used 
to for loop through the length of the string provided, if there isn't a space then you add onto 
the stack, while the stack is not 0 cout the top of the stack and pop the top of 
the stack until the stack is empty.
