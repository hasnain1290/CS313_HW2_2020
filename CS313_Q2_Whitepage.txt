White Page Q2:

So our job was to write the prefix stack instead of a postfix or infix stack and then show how it 
would work in main. The way we did this was through making 2 functions, one being operand and another 
named evalPrefix. Majority of the function is done through evalPrefix, which has a for loop to go through 
the entirety of the size of the string. which was and then check to whether it was a decimal and return 
the number as true as long as there still is chars and to ensure the string is converted into a number from 
string is you minus '0' from it to switch it (ASCII values). Create two operators to call the top of the 
stack and the next value needed for the operation have a switch for each of the operations + - * /.
The int main was used to create the string used to be processed by this prefix stack, I tried multiple operations
together as well to ensure the prefix stack worked.
